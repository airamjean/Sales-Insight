# Sales Insight Project

This project focused on extracting and refining sales data from a relational database to support accurate and actionable insights. Using Power BI's Power Query Editor, the data was systematically cleanedâ€”addressing missing values, correcting inconsistent entries, removing duplicates, and ensuring proper data types. Once the data was transformed and validated, an interactive dashboard was developed to visualize key sales metrics such as revenue trends, product performance, regional sales distribution, and customer segments. The resulting dashboard enabled stakeholders to gain a comprehensive understanding of sales performance and supported strategic decision-making.
